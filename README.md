# 🏦 Bank Customer Churn Prediction

This project uses *machine learning* to predict whether a customer will leave a bank based on their transaction history and personal details.

## 📌 Features
- Uses *Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost* models.
- Provides accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
- Can be run in *Jupyter Notebook* or as a Python script.
  

- 📊 Data Used
The dataset consists of bank customers' information, including:

Geography, Gender, Age, Credit Score, Balance,Estimated Salary, Active Member,No of products(how many services they use) etc.
